# Telematics-GPS-data
The goal of this project is in two parts. The first part involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering of a GPS data which contains spatial variables(longitude and latitudes) of sample trips of vehicles over recorded times.  The data set contains 9687 rows and 4 variables. The second part is on Model building using a 1 Hz hypothetical data on some telematics variables on 30,000 vehicles. The objective of this stage is to build a model that segments the vehicles based on the likelihood that they will have a collision.
